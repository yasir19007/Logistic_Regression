# Logistic_Regression

In today's digital world, businesses are constantly looking for ways to reach their target audience through advertising. One way to do this is to use machine learning to predict whether or not a user will click on an ad.

In this project, we will use a fake advertising dataset to train a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a user will click on an ad. The dataset includes features such as the user's age, gender, location, Daily Time Spent on Site(Avg), Area Income (Avg), Daily Internet use, clicked on ad etc. We will use these features to train a logistic regression model that can predict the probability of a user clicking on an ad.

Once we have trained our model, we can use it to predict whether or not a user will click on an ad in real time. This information can be used to target ads more effectively and improve the return on investment for businesses.

We have also performed in-depth exploratory data analysis on the dataset. This analysis will help us understand the factors that influence ad clicks and identify any potential biases in the data.

This project is a great example of how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems. By predicting ad clicks, businesses can improve their advertising campaigns and reach their target audience more effectively.
